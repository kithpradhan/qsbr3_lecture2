## an example

Imagine an urn filled with 400 gold and 600 black balls all mixed up.  You dip your hand in and pull out a handful(10 balls).  How many of the 10 are gold?

## hypergeometric distribution {.build}

If you start with an urn filled with 400 gold and 600 black balls and pull out a handful of 10 balls, the probability of winding up with *8* gold balls can be found from a hypergeometric distribution with the following parameters:


```{r, echo=T}
  dhyper(x=8, m=400, n=600, k=10)

```

## hypergeometric distribution {.build .smaller}

can we calculate the probability of pulling out all possible values of *x* gold balls?


```{r, echo=T}
  probs =  dhyper(x=0:10, m=400, n=600, k=10)
  plot(0:10, probs)

```



## hypergeometric distribution {.build .smaller}
Using the same parameters as above, what's the probability of pulling out *8 or more* gold balls?


```{r, echo=T}
  probs = dhyper(x=8:10, m=400, n=600, k=10)
  probs
  sum(probs)

```

## Why is this important? { .build}

> * Instead of thinking of gold and black balls, let's think of significant/non-significant genes.  

> * In our zika example we looked at a total of *17759* genes.  Of these, *2497* showed significant differential expression between groups, *17759 - 2497 = 15262* were non-significant.

> * Let's pick an arbitrary GO term from the biological processes, GO:0035308 (negative regulation of protein dephosphorylation).  

> * This pathway consists of *62* unique genes, and *13* of them 
are in our list of significant zika genes.

> * How to we turn this into our hypergeometric urn problem?

## zika problem

* *2497* significant genes
* *15262* non-significant genes
* *62* genes in the go pathway
* *13* of the go pathway genes are are significant


## urn problem {.build}

* *2497* gold balls
* *15262* black balls
* *62* balls in our handful
* *13* of the balls in our hand are gold

> * what's the probability of getting 13 or more gold balls in our handful?

```{r, echo=T}

  sum(dhyper(13:62, 2497, 15262, 62))

```


## zika problem {.build}

* *2497* significant genes
* *15262* non-significant genes
* *62* genes in the go pathway
* *13* of the go pathway genes are are significant
* If we sampled 62 genes at random from our set what are the chances 
we'd find 13 or more significant genes?

```{r, echo=T}

  sum(dhyper(13:62, 2497, 15262, 62))

```

Is the negative regulation of protein dephosphorylation pathway over represented with genes that are associated with zika?

> * That's the p-value above!
